# ORNL House Project

This repository contains the notebooks for the full project I have been working the past two weeks using the ORNL sensor data. The ORNL hour is a research house in Tennessee, USA that is loaded with various sensors. Using the dataset found here [](), I have worked on a full data science project that demonstrates how energy sensor data can be combined with weather data to predict energy consumption.
